3/28/1979,"Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania, United States","Loss of coolant and partial core meltdown due to operator errors and technical flaws. There was a small release of radioactive gases. See also Three Mile Island accident health effects.",0
9/15/1984,"Athens, Alabama, United States","Safety violations, operator error and design problems forced a six-year outage at Browns Ferry Unit 2.",0
3/9/1985,"Athens, Alabama, United States","Instrumentation systems malfunction during startup, which led to suspension of operations at all three Browns Ferry Units",0
4/11/1986,"Chernobyl, Chernobyl Raion (now Vyshhorod Raion), Kiev Oblast, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union","A flawed reactor design and inadequate safety procedures led to a power surge that damaged the fuel rods of reactor no. 4 of the Chernobyl power plant. This caused an explosion and meltdown, necessitating the evacuation of 300,000 people and dispersing radioactive material across Europe (see Effects of the Chernobyl disaster). Around 5% (5200 PBq) of the core was released into the atmosphere and downwind. ",28

3/31/1987,"Delta, Pennsylvania, United States","Peach Bottom units 2 and 3 shutdown due to cooling malfunctions and unexplained equipment problems",0
12/19/1987,"Lycoming, New York, United States","Malfunctions forced Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation to shut down Nine Mile Point Unit 1",0
17/3/1989,"Lusby, Maryland, United States","Inspections at Calvert Cliff Units 1 and 2 revealed cracks at pressurized heater sleeves, forcing extended shutdowns",0
10/19/1989,"Vandellòs, Spain","A fire damaged the cooling system in unit 1 of the Vandellòs Nuclear Power Plant, getting the core close to meltdown. The cooling system was restored before the meltdown but the unit had to be shut down due to the elevated cost of the repair.",0
